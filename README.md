# Ezell_Amanda_MMP210
This was my first project I did in MMP100. I think it turned out pretty good, 
its a selfie of me, layered upon a picture I took of some graffiti I saw in Toronto.
I outlined the work done to make it look a bit more "Cartoonie". I think it helps 
represent me, as I am a fan of street art and I elaborated it to help make the 
background pop a bit more.
